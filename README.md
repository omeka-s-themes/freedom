# Freedom S: An Omeka S Theme

This is an Omeka S theme that offers some custom options and a clean design.

## Installation

For basic out-of-the-box use of the theme, follow the [Omeka S User Manual instructions for installing themes](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/sites/site_theme/#installing-themes).

For more advanced use, such as customizing the theme with Sass, you'll need to install the tools with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater). Navigate to your theme directory and run `npm install`.

## Theme Configuration



## Customizing the Theme

If you want to customize the site with your own CSS, the [CSS Editor](https://omeka.org/s/modules/CSSEditor/) module allows site administrators to write style overrides.

For advanced CSS and Sass users, this theme includes variables and mixins for managing and extending many styles.

### Sass Tasks

Run these commands within the theme's root directory.

* **npm start**: While this task runs, it watches for changes to sass files and recompiles the CSS.
* **gulp css**: This is the one-off task for compiling the current Sass/CSS.
* * **gulp css:watch**: This task watches for changes in the Sass, then compiles the CSS.
